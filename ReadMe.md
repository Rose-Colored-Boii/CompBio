Python script for writing color data to models of protein structures.

Workflow:

1) Download PDB file online (via RCSB, AlphaFold, etc.)
2) Use tools like Chimera, PyMOL, etc. to export PDB to GLTF glb file
3) Run script to convert to obj file
4) Open obj in Bambu Studio and map colors to filaments
